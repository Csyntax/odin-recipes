        <h2>Ukwa </h2>
        <p>Ukwa, also known as African breadfruit, is a delicious Nigerian dish that is popular in the southeastern region of the country. It's made from cooked breadfruit seeds and often served as a main course. Here's a typical recipe description for Ukwa:
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups dried ukwa (breadfruit seeds)</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons palm oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
            <li>A2-3 stock cubes (seasoning cubes)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Water for cooking</li>
            <p><strong><em>Optional Ingredients</em></strong></p>
            <li>Smoked fish or stockfish (pre-soaked and deboned)</li>
            <li>Periwinkle (optional, cleaned and washed)</li>
            <li>Pepper (fresh or dried, to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the dried ukwa seeds thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Place the cleaned ukwa in a large bowl and soak it in enough water to cover it. Leave it to soak overnight or for at least 8 hours. This helps to soften the seeds and reduce cooking time.</li>
            <li>After soaking, drain the water from the ukwa seeds and transfer them to a clean pot. Add enough fresh water to cover the seeds, and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and let the ukwa simmer until it becomes tender. This may take about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir occasionally and check for tenderness.</li>
            <li>While the ukwa is cooking, prepare the other ingredients. Chop the onion, debone the smoked fish or stockfish if using, and gather the ground crayfish, palm oil, stock cubes, salt, and optional pepper.</li>
            <li>Once the ukwa is tender, drain any excess water from it and set it aside in a bowl.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot, heat the palm oil over medium heat until it's hot but not smoking. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they are translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked ukwa to the pot with the sautéed onions. Stir well to combine, ensuring the ukwa is coated with the palm oil and onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the ground crayfish, stock cubes, and salt to taste. If using, add the smoked fish or stockfish at this point. Stir everything together gently to distribute the flavors evenly.</li>
            <li>If desired, add the cleaned and washed periwinkle to the ukwa pot. Periwinkle adds a unique flavor to the dish.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and let the ukwa simmer on low heat for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Taste the ukwa and adjust the seasoning if needed. If you prefer a spicier flavor, you can add some chopped fresh or dried pepper at this stage.</li>
            <li>Once fully cooked and seasoned to your liking, remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve the delicious Ukwa hot as a main dish, garnished with additional chopped onions or fresh herbs if desired. It pairs well with a side of plantains, yam, or rice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ukwa is known for its nutty flavor and hearty texture, making it a satisfying and wholesome meal that's enjoyed across Nigeria, especially in Igbo cuisine.</p>

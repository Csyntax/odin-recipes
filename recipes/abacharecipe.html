            <li>Garden eggs (sliced) or garden egg leaves - optional</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the Abacha (cassava flakes). Place the dried Abacha in a bowl and soak it in warm water for about 5-10 minutes to soften slightly. If using potash or baking soda, dissolve a small amount in water and add it to the soaked Abacha. Mix well and let it sit for another 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly to remove any traces of potash or baking soda, then drain and set aside. </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, prepare the seasoning mixture. Combine the chopped onions, palm oil, ground crayfish, stock cubes, salt, and pepper. Mix well to form a flavorful dressing for the Abacha.</li>
            <li>If using optional ingredients like ugba, kpomo, garden eggs, ukpaka, or meat/fish, ensure they are cleaned, cooked (if necessary), and diced or sliced accordingly.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened and drained Abacha with the seasoning mixture. Toss well to ensure the Abacha is evenly coated with the flavors.</li>
            <li>Add the optional ingredients such as ugba, kpomo, garden eggs, ukpaka, or meat/fish to the Abacha mixture. Gently fold everything together to incorporate the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Taste the Abacha and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or seasoning cubes according to your preference.</li>
            <li>If desired, garnish the Abacha with sliced utazi leaves, uziza leaves, or scent leaves for added freshness and aroma.</li>
            <li>Serve the Abacha alongside your choice of protein, such as smoked fish, boiled fish, grilled meat, or any other preferred accompaniment.</li>

        </ol>
        <P>Abacha is best enjoyed fresh and can be served as a snack, appetizer, or side dish during gatherings, celebrations, or as a tasty treat at home. Its combination of flavors, textures, and optional ingredients makes it a versatile and delightful dish in Nigerian cuisine.</P>
